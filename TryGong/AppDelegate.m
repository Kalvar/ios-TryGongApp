#pragma Facebook SDK 3.1.1 處理流程
// FBSample logic
// The native facebook application transitions back to an authenticating application when the user
// chooses to either log in, or cancel. The url passed to this method contains the token in the
// case of a successful login. By passing the url to the handleOpenURL method of a session object
// the session object can parse the URL, and capture the token for use by the rest of the authenticating
// application; the return value of handleOpenURL indicates whether or not the URL was handled by the
// session object, and does not reflect whether or not the login was successful; the session object's
// state, as well as its arguments passed to the state completion handler indicate whether the login
// was successful; note that if the session is nil or closed when handleOpenURL is called, the expression
// will be boolean NO, meaning the URL was not handled by the authenticating application

// FBSample logic
// Whether it is in applicationWillTerminate, in applicationDidEnterBackground, or in some other part
// of your application, it is important that you close an active session when it is no longer useful
// to your application; if a session is not properly closed, a retain cycle may occur between the block
// and an object that holds a reference to the session object; close releases the handler, breaking any
// inadvertant retain cycles

    // releasing (completion block, etc.) and other components in the app may be awaiting
    // close notification in order to do cleanup

// FBSample logic
// It is possible for the user to switch back to your application, from the native Facebook application,
// when the user is part-way through a login; You can check for the FBSessionStateCreatedOpenening
// state in applicationDidBecomeActive, to identify this situation and close the session; a more sophisticated
// application may choose to notify the user that they switched away from the Facebook application without
// completely logging in
